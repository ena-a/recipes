<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>Note: Ingredient measurements are approximate and/or to taste.</p>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups Broccoli florets, cooked and drained</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Oil</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Optional:
        <ul>
            <li>Pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1-1/2 teaspoons Soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Sesame oil</li>
        </ul>

    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Broccoli florets may be cooked by method of your preference, that is, microwave, steamed, boiled.</li>
    <li>In separate small pan, heat oil, add red pepper flakes. Lightly brown red pepper flakes -- be careful not
        to burn them. The goal is to get the oil very hot. Remove pan from heat.</li>
    <li>Carefully drizzle hot oil over cooked broccoli. Oil will sizzle, and may splatter.</li>
    <li>Season with salt, black pepper, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Gently toss, being careful not to break broccoli
        florets.
    </li>
