# recipes - practice repository

The purpose of this project is to practice HTML and git.

Skills used to complete project:

- Create a GitHub repository

- Git basic commands and workflow

- HTML tags for headings, ordered and unordered lists, images, and links.

Note: Try the "Easy Broccoli" recipe. It's one of my favorites! If you make it, let me know how it turned out.
